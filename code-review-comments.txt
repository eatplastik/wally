Code Review Comments from Michelle and Mike

Good points:
- cool readme.md
- invite code generation was very innovative.
- css and look and feel was consistent and appropriate to the website theme
- code is clear and straight forward


Points to improve
- routes could have been separated in a routes.js
- add comments around the main route handler functions.
